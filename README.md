Hello, My name is Tomek I am a researcher from Poland. I am working as assistant professor at the University of Science and Technology AGH in Krak√≥w, and the mainstream of my research is focused on thermal analysis. I use DSC as the main method to analyse such thermal properties of metals and alloys such as specific heat, enthalpy or temperatures of phase transitions.
I also have some programming skills. I write programs in c, c ++ and delphi.
